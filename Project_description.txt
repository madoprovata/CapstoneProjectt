Task: To develop an end-to-end machine learning pipeline
that predicts global temperature anomalies based on historical data.
The project will include building a predictive model
using Machine Learning (ML), deploying it with Streamlit,
and visualizing the results using Tableau/Power BI.

Objective: The objective is to create a comprehensive
tool that allows users to analyze global temperature
anomalies, make future predictions, and visually
explore climate trends.

Dataset Description: This dataset provides monthly temperature
anomalies from 1880 to the present, with each row representing
a different year. The temperature anomalies are compared to a
long-term baseline (typically the 20th-century average) and
are measured in degrees Celsius.

Columns in Dataset:
1. Year: The year of observation.
2. Month Columns (Jan-Dec): The temperature anomaly
   for each month (from January to December).
3. J-D: The annual mean temperature anomaly
   (based on all 12 months of the year).
4. D-N: The December to November temperature anomaly.
5. Seasonal Columns (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON):
   o DJF: Winter temperature anomaly (December, January, February).
   o MAM: Spring temperature anomaly (March, April, May).
   o JJA: Summer temperature anomaly (June, July, August).
   o SON: Fall temperature anomaly (September, October, November).
