# Capstone Project 

This project develops an end-to-end machine learning pipepline that predicts 
global temperature anmoalies based on historical data. 

## Instructions on how to run the code 

1. Run the 'Data_Preprocessing.py' file.
   This file performs data cleaning operations
2. Run 'Feature_engineering.py' file.
   This file performs feature engineering processes, like creating moving avergae columns,
   and time-based features.
3. Run 'eda.py' file.
   This file visualises the trends of the data, including heatmpats, line plots and KDE plots.
4. Run 'model.py' file.
   This file performs machine learning model develeopment
   This file includes model selection, model training and model evaluations.
5. Run 'app.py' file by writing in the terminal "streamlit run app.py".
   This file builds the streamlit app by deplyoing the trained models in order to
   make future temperature anomaly predictions
   Usee the dropdown menus and to sliders to interact with the app and extract specific information
